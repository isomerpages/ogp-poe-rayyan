<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>1. What are the design choices and thought processes you have made with the site?</strong></h4>
<p>I used a website called <a href="http://coolor.co" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coolor.co</a> to find inspiration for a nice colour
scheme that blends well. I then tested the contrast of the primary and
secondary colours to ensure that it fulfils the minimum colour contrast
of 4.5 for accessibility. I made a simple logo from the colour scheme to
have some consistency with the site.</p>
<p>Other than that, I just played around with the features and see what worked
on a page. I also added more content on some pages as I felt they looked
a bit bare and I wanted to mimic an actual site.</p>
<p>For the remaining pages that were filled with "Lorem Ispsums", I decided
to copy what I found from Govtech Singapore website as it was built by
isomer as well and had specific terms that would mock how the page would
actually look like if it was filled with content.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Why were these content shared chosen for this?</strong></h4>
<p>The content shared was through personal experiences and actual places
I've been to. It was actually quite a challenge to come up with places
to recommend as I'm not a picky eater so I enjoy most of the food I've
eaten.</p>
<p>For the speeches, I thought it was nice to look at the start and end of
Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong's career and contrast that with Prime Minister
Lawrence Wong's past present and future.</p>
<p>Lastly, for the cool things I've shared, I thought it was fun to make
use of the table to showcase different websites I thought were interesting,
and added a couple more pictures of some personal things I liked as well,
to give it a personal touch. I added a .gif file just to see if it works
on the site.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Your thoughts on the assignment?</strong></h4>
<p>Overall it was a really fun assignment! I enjoyed my time building this
site and experimenting with all the different features IsomerCMS has. I
love how the guides were very detailed and user-friendly, and appreciate
how all of the decisions made were backed with proper research. I hope
the fun I felt translate into a pleasant site for you for viewing.</p>
