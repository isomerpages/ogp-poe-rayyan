<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>1. What are the design choices and thought processes you have made with the site?</strong></h4>
<p>I used a website called <a href="http://coolor.co" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coolor.co</a> to find inspiration for a nice colour
scheme that blends well. I then tested the contrast of the primary and
secondary colours to ensure that it fulfils the minimum colour contrast
of 4.5 for accessibility. I made a simple logo from the colour scheme to
have some consistency with the site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the remaining pages that were filled with Lorem Ispsums, I decided
to copy what I found from Govtech Singapore website as it was built by
isomer as well and had specific terms that would mock how the page would
actually look like if it was filled with content.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Why were these content shared chosen for this?</strong></h4>
<p>The content shared was through personal experiences and actual places
I've been to. It was actually quite a challenge to come up with places
to recommend as I'm not a picky eater so I enjoy most of the food I've
eaten. For the speeches, I thought it was nice to look at the start and
end of Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong's career and contrast that with
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's past present and future. Lastly, for the
cool things I've shared, I thought it was fun to make use of the table
to showcase different websites I thought were interesting, and added a
couple more pictures of some personal things I liked as well.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Your thoughts on the assignment?</strong></h4>
<p>Overall it was a really fun assignment and I enjoyed my time building
this site. I love how the guides were very detailed and user-friendly,
and appreciate how many of the decisions were backed with proper research.
I hope the fun I felt translate into a pleasant site for you for viewing.</p>
