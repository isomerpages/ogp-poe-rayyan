<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>1. What were the design choices and thought processes you have made with the site?</strong></h4>
<p>I used a website called <a href="http://coolor.co" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coolor.co</a> to find inspiration for a nice colour
scheme that blends well. I then tested the contrast of the primary and
secondary colours to ensure that it fulfils the minimum colour contrast
of 4.5 for accessibility. I made a simple logo from the colour scheme to
maintain consistency with the site. Other resources were from <a href="http://pexel.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pexel.com</a> or
my own.</p>
<p>Other than that, I just experimented with the features to see what worked
on a page. I also added more content on some pages as I felt they looked
a bit bare, and I wanted to mimic the experience of an actual site.</p>
<p>For the remaining pages filled with "Lorem Ispsums", I decided to copy
the content found on Govtech Singapore website, as it was built by isomer
as well and had specific terms that would mock how the page would actually
look like if it was filled with content.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Why was the content shared chosen?</strong></h4>
<p>The content shared comes from my personal experiences and actual places
I've been to. It was actually quite a challenge to come up with recommendations,
as I'm not a picky eater and enjoy most of the food I've eaten.</p>
<p>For the speeches, I thought it was interesting to look at the start and
end of Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong's career and contrast that with
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Lastly, for the cool things I've shared, I thought it was fun to make
use of the table to showcase different websites I found interesting. I
added a couple personal pictures of things I liked as well to give it a
personal touch. I added a .gif image linked with a URL to see how it would
work on the site.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Your thoughts on the assignment?</strong></h4>
<p>Overall it was a really fun assignment! I enjoyed my time building this
site and experimenting with all the different features IsomerCMS offers.
I love how the guides were very detailed and user-friendly, and appreciate
how all of the decisions made were backed with proper research. I hope
the fun I felt translated into a pleasant site for you to view.</p>
