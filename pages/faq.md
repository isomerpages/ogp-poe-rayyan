<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>1. What are the design choices and thought processes you have made with the site?</strong></h4>
<p>I used a website called <a href="http://coolor.co" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coolor.co</a> to find inspiration for a nice colour
scheme that blends well.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Why were these content shared chosen for this?</strong></h4>
<p>The content shared was through personal experiences and actual places
I've been to. It was actually quite challenging to come up with places
to recommend as I'm not a picky eater so I enjoy most of the food I've
eaten. For the speeches, I thought it was nice to look at the start and
end of Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong's career and contrast that with
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's past and present. Lastly, for the cool things
I've shared, I thought it was fun to make use of the table to showcase
different websites I thought interesting, and added a couple more pictures
of some personal things I liked as well.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Your thoughts on the assignment?</strong></h4>
<p>Overall a really fun assignment and I enjoyed my time building this site.
I enjoyed how the guide was very detailed and user-friendly, and appreciate
how many of the decisions were backed with proper research. I hope you
enjoy your time here too!</p>
