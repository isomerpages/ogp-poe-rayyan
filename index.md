        - title: Home's Where the Heart is
          date: 13 June 2024
          announcement: Inspired by countless cooking videos online, I decided to try
            cooking one of the hardest meals all chefs fear, the humble
            omelette. The heat, the technique, it was all too much for me.
            Though not what I wanted to achieve, I settled for scrambled eggs
            instead. 8/10 for effort, 5/10 for taste.

        - title: Broth for the Soul
          date: 10 June 2024
          announcement: Hands down, the best Prawn Mee I've ever eaten. Located at
            Kembangan and Jurong, Deanna's Kitchen is home to the best Prawn Mee
            served fresh daily. The best thing about the dish is the amazing
            prawn broth that will leave you wanting more.

        - title: A Fun Day with Satay
          date: 08 June 2024
          announcement: What is the perfect Satay? The meat should be marinated well, not
            too chewy and accompanied with a peanut sauce that leaves your arms
            tired from that constant dipping. Where is the best satay? I don't
            think you'll ever get one answer, but I like the one at East Coast
            Lagoon!
