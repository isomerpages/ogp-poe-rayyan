        - title: Home's Where the Heart is
          date: 13 June 2024
          announcement: Inspired by countless cooking videos online, I decided to try
            cooking one of the hardest meals all chefs fear, the humble
            omelette. The heat, the technique, it was all too much for me.
            Though not what I wanted to achieve, I settled for scrambled eggs
            instead. 8/10 for effort, 5/10 for taste.

          date: 10 June 2024
          announcement: Honestly, one of the best prawn mee I've had in a long time.
            Deanna's Kitchen, located in Kembangan area has one of the most
            delicious prawn mee's I've ever experienced.

        - title: A Fun Day with Satay
          date: 08 June 2024
          announcement: What is the perfect Satay? The meat should be marinated well, not
            too chewy and accompanied by a peanut sauce that leaves your arms
            tired from that constant dipping.
